TodoApp is the first application I have created in my life.
It's about adding to-do tasks to your list.
I have implemented such functionalities as adding, deleting and the ability to edit tasks.
There are two roles, admin and user. Admin role has an extra administration panel where he can view all the accounts available in the database and delete them.
